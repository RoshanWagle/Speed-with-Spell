Project Description:

"Speed with Spell" is an interactive typing speed and accuracy test program created using Python and the Tkinter library. The project is designed to help users improve their typing skills by testing their speed and accuracy while typing a given paragraph. The application displays real-time statistics such as words per minute (WPM), total words typed, wrong words, and accuracy percentage. The virtual keyboard visually highlights keys as users type, providing a responsive and engaging experience.

This project can be used for practicing typing, improving typing speed, and refining accuracy, all while offering a fun and competitive challenge.

Key Features:

  Typing Speed Test: Allows users to type a paragraph within a timed session (default 80 seconds). The time countdown and progress are displayed in real-time.
  WPM and Accuracy Calculation: Measures typing speed in terms of words per minute (WPM) and calculates typing accuracy by comparing typed words against the provided paragraph.
  Dynamic GUI: The user interface is built using Tkinter, featuring clear labels, a text area for input, and a virtual keyboard that responds to user inputs with visual cues.
  Error Tracking: Tracks incorrect words and displays the total wrong words typed in real time.
  Threaded Execution: Separate threads manage the timer and input handling to ensure smooth real-time updates without freezing the GUI.
  Reset and Exit Options: Users can reset the test or exit the program after completing a typing session.
